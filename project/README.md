## About This Project



## How to use this script

   - Open the python file called `anime.py` and execute the code. The script will initiate a Flask API that can be operated on your browser.
   - On the terminal, a link with your IP address will be created. Click the link and it will redirect you to your browser and start the API.
   - On the API you will be able to search the animes on the database, and also update, add and delete information/animes.

## Technical Requirements

python = 3.12.7
Flask = 2.3.2
